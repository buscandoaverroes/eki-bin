# The LED output layer: the strip object, gamma + temporal dithering, and
# the single np.write() every render path converges on. Extracted verbatim
# from main.py by the V1.6 split (docs/v1.6-refactor.md).
#
# `_physical()` lives here rather than with the contracts on purpose: it is
# the HAL seam a per-hardware driver would own (reversed strips, ring
# wrap-around, dead-pixel gaps), and only _write_frame/_paint_layers use it.
# Contracts speak in LOGICAL positions and never learn how the strip is
# physically wired.
#
# ⚠ Importing this module builds `np` from LED_PIN/NUM_LEDS immediately, so
# those two cannot be reported through the LEDs — there is no strip yet when
# they are consumed. A wrong LED_PIN is also a POWER fault, not merely a
# display one: docs/insights.md §13.
#
# [→ Rust] np.write() becomes a PIO/RMT program clocking the 800kHz WS2812B
#          waveform in hardware.
